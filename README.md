# GamesWithATwist-Pong
This is the first game of what I hope will be a series of games I make to practice the basics of game dev. 
I'm calling this series "Games with a Twist", where my goal is to re-make classic games (or parts of said games) in Godot 4, but adding my own twist to them.

My version of Pong will have power-ups that spawn randomly through the board, which dynamically affect how the game works. These are:
* Slowdown: Reduces movement speed of the other player by 10%
* Rewind: Bounces the ball back to where it initially came from, taking its approach-angle in account
* Split: Splits the ball in two. Each ball can score once
* Speed-Up: Increases the speed of the ball by 50%

Every effect stacks with every other effect, and only resets when the match is over. Power ups spawn in random spots of the game board, and the ball needs to hit them for them to activate.

Expect these games to have very basic art, animation and effects. I'm by no means an artistic person.

# About me 
Hey, I'm a seasoned software engineer, with over 16 years of experience working on both startups and big tech, including AWS and Block.
I'm currently taking a side quest to teach myself how to make 2D games in Godot. I'm loving the process so far, and hope to stick around for a little longer :)
